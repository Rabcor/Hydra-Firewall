# Hydra-Firewall
Hydra's Firewall front-end.

This firewall will mostly revolve around the feature of auto-detecting when an application needs access to a closed port and asking the user if he wants to allow it through the firewall or not (a feature surprisingly absent from linux firewall frontends...)

I may also implement the home/public network policies approach.
